You stumble through the dark into the trees nearby. After walking a few hundred feet, you hear something rustling in the brush close by. Startled, you begin to run.

Unfortunately, you trip on a branch and hit your head on a rock. Whatever made the noise has fled, but you feel hot blood running down your face and the silence begins to envelope you.

The end.
